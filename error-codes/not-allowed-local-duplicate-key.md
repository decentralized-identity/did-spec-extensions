# Extension Error Code: `notAllowedLocalDuplicateKey`

This specification defines a new error code, to be included in the [DID Spec Registries](https://w3c.github.io/did-spec-registries/).

## Status

Work-in-progress

## Syntax

The error code is `notAllowedLocalDuplicateKey`.

## Definition

This DID Resolution error code is used to indicate that a security policy has been triggered, and duplicate keys
have been detected in the DID document.

The DID Resolution Metadata MAY include additional information about why the security policy has been triggered.

## Examples

```json
{
	"@context": "https://w3id.org/did-resolution/v1",
	"didDocument": null,
	"didResolutionMetadata": {
		"error": "notAllowedLocalDuplicateKey"
	},
	"didDocumentMetadata": {}
}
```

# DID Resolution Option: `checkLocalDuplicateKey`

This specification also defines a new DID Resolution Option.

## Definition

This DID Resolution Option can be used by a client to override the behavior of the security policy.

Possible values:

* `error`: A DID Resolution Result with error `notAllowedLocalDuplicateKey` is returned if the security policy is triggered.
* `warn`: A normal DID Resolution Result is returned, but a warning is included in the `didResolutionMetadata` field.
* `ignore`: The security policy is ignored, and a normal DID Resolution Result is returned.
